### The Florida Story

Florida was the **lowest-rated 1-seed** (Barthag 0.971, Adj EV 7.65%) but **won the championship**.

The market priced Florida at 8.07% (Price EV), which was:
- Below the naive 1-seed EV of 8.75%
- Above the model's Adj EV of 7.65%

So the market correctly identified Florida as the weakest 1-seed but still paid a slight premium over the model's fair value. Florida's championship run (+388% ROI) illustrates tournament variance.

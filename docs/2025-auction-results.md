### The Florida Story

Florida was the **lowest-rated 1-seed** (Barthag 0.971, Adj EV 7.65%) but **won the championship**. This illustrates tournament variance — even correctly-valued teams have ~7-8% championship probability, meaning surprises happen.

However, Florida was also **underpriced**: paid $1,700 vs fair value of $1,611 (Adj EV × pot). The market correctly identified Florida as the weakest 1-seed but still paid a slight premium.
